JUnit 
JUnit is an unit testing automation framework that is used for testing the actual code to certify whether it is working properly or not


Unit testing = is the process of testing & certifying the code written by the developer by himself to ensure the code he is delivering is tested/verified and meets the quality criteria. Unittesting automation became integral part of ci/cd implementation.
	
class Calculator {
	public int add(int a, int b) {
		return a+b;
	}
}	

class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
		int sum = calculator.add(10, 20);
		sop("sum : " + sum);
	}
}

testing = testing is the process of verifying the code with pre-defined inputs (test fixture) and verifying the output produced by the original code is matching with the expected output or not is called "testing"
	
An unit test automation code should execute the actual code with pre-defined set of inputs and capture the output and evaluate the actual output produced is matching with expected output or not and produce a test result as pass/fail is called "unit test automation"
	
To implement the unit test automation in java, The JUnit Framework has been provided. The developers can use JUnit in quickly producing the testautomation code

class Calculator {
	public int add(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}


class CalculatorTest {
	Calculator calculator;
	int a;
	int b;
	int expectedSum;
	int na;
	int nb;
	int nexpectedSum;
	
	@Before
	public void setup() {
		calculator = new Calculator();
		a = 10;
		b = 20;		
		expectedSum = 30;
		na=-10;
		nb=-1;
		nexpectedSum=-11;
	}

	@Test
	public void testAddPositiveNumbers() {
		int actualSum = 0;
		actualSum = calculator.add(a, b);
		Assert.assertEquals(expectedSum, actualSum);
	}
	
	@Test
	public void testAddNegativeNumbers() {
		int actualSum = 0;
		actualSum = calculator.add(na, nb);
		Assert.assertEquals(nexpectedSum, actualSum);
	}
	
	@After
	public void cleanUp() {
		calculator = null;
	}
	
}
